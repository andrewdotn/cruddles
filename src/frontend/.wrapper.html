<!--
This file exists because parcel doesn’t put hashes in names of top-level files.

This top-level file references the other scripts, which get cache-safe names
like `client.9993b7e2.js`. To find those names in production, we parse the
parcel-bundled version of this file. In development, we can use the dev server
API to get the names as they’re generated.
